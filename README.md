### **Project: Solid Waste Prediction Using LSTM and XGBoost**  

This project aims to predict daily solid waste generation using machine learning techniques. It leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to capture time-dependent patterns and **XGBoost** for structured feature analysis. By blending these models, the system achieves improved accuracy in forecasting waste amounts. The dataset is preprocessed with cyclic encoding for seasonal trends, and predictions are evaluated using **RMSE, RÂ² Score, MAE, and Explained Variance (EV).** The goal is to help municipalities optimize waste management and resource allocation effectively.
