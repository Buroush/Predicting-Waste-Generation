# Predicting-Waste-Generation
This project predicts daily solid waste generation using LSTM and XGBoost models. It captures time-based patterns and seasonal trends, improving accuracy. The system helps municipalities optimize waste management by evaluating predictions with RMSE, RÂ², MAE, and EV scores.
